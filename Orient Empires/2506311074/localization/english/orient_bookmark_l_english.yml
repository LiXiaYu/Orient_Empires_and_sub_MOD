Although the later Emperor Xianzong revived the Tang Dynasty, the situation was only a delicate balance between the Court and most Commissioners. Under this changeable situation, peace was just a break. But no one ever thought that it was a grain magistrate rebel, Pang Xun, who ignited the flame that brings the Empire to the edge of collapse...\n\n And don't forget that those kings, Khans and chiefs around the Empire are also seeking weakness of the Empire like wolves. Inside the Empire, crafty officials in the Court are competing for power secretly, and those strong Military Commissioners are enlarging their own army and lands everyday.\n\nTai Zong Emperor, the greatest monarch of Tang Dynasty, believed that 'water can carry a boat or capsize it'. So be careful, new ruler, please remember that those uncontrollable forces will finally devour you."
